This repository contains multiple assignments for the IZU course. Each project demonstrates different computational
algorithms ranging from pathfinding and clustering to data processing in Prolog.

## Projects Overview

### 1. UCS Pathfinding in a Grid

Implement the Uniform Cost Search (UCS) method to find the shortest path on a grid. Impassable
cells are marked with "Z".

### 2. Prolog Odd Number Filter

Implement a Prolog predicate `u20(LIN, LOUT)` to filter out even numbers from a list, retaining
only odd integers.

### 3. ID3 Decision Tree Generator

Generate a decision classification tree using the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm based
on provided data including attributes, classes, and observations.


### 4. 3D K-means Clustering Algorithm

Organize a set of points in 3D space into three clusters using the K-means clustering method with
predefined centroids.
